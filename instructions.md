Build a page with a form containing input

-form that takes some inputs from the user
and stores it in an array 


use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays:

Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.

Then, use Array.prototype.push() to add only these elements (2nd, 1st, and 3rd) to a brand new array.

Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag. Use the document.createElement() and Element.append() or Element.prepend() methods to create and add elements to your webpage.
